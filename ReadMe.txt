Questions:
 1. There is particular interest in squirrel with ID 6D-PM-1020-01. This squirrel repeatedly runs onto the baseball field and seems fearless of the players on the field. This squirrel was observed in Hectare 06D. Insert a column to the right of the Hectare column. Call it Near BB Squirrel. Use a formula to identify squirrels who were observed in adjacent hectares (05D, 07D, 06C, and 06E). Use a filter to isolate just the 31 adjacent squirrels.
2. Find the squirrels that seemed threatened. Communicating threats may take the form of Quaas, Moans, Tail Flags, or Run(ning) From according to the documentation.
3.  Create another column to find all the squirrels who we know for sure do not have a primary color of gray.
